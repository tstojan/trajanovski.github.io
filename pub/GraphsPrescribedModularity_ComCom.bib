	abstract = {Modularity is a quantitative measure for characterizing the existence of a community structure in a network. A networkâ€™s modularity depends on the chosen partitioning of the network into communities, which makes finding the specific partition that leads to the maximum modularity a hard problem. In this paper, we prove that deciding whether a graph with a given number of links, number of communities, and modularity exists is NP-complete and subsequently propose a heuristic algorithm for generating graphs with a given modularity. Our graph generator allows constructing graphs with a given number of links and different topological properties. The generator can be used in the broad field of modeling and analyzing clustered social or organizational networks.}}
